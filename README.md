The gameplay loop is endless. Your goal is to maintain a positive balance of credits while trying to find the most valuable poker hand. During the draw round, you have the option to discard up to 3 cards from your hand.
Once you redraw, your initial bet gets increased by a multiplier based on the rarity of the poker hand.

The first version is lacking a couple of features and functionality. To advance the game state, use the Hold button.
